# Lone Rock Bible Church Website

Welcome to the official repository for the Lone Rock Bible Church website! This project is a modern and responsive website built using Astro, Tailwind CSS, React, TypeScript, and Flowbite.

## About Lone Rock Bible Church

[Lone Rock Bible Church](https://lonerockbiblechurch.com) serves as an online platform to connect with the church community, access information about events, and stay updated on the latest news and teachings.

## Technologies Used

- **Astro:** A modern static site generator that combines the best of traditional static sites and modern front-end workflows.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that streamlines designing and building modern, responsive websites.

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offering a component-based architecture for creating interactive web applications.

- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and provides better tooling for large-scale applications.

- **Flowbite:** A lightweight and flexible Tailwind CSS component library that enhances the UI development process.

## Features

- **Coming Events Widget:** Implemented a custom widget that parses JSON data into a calendar for displaying upcoming events. I originally used the Google Calendar API but I found that it didn't have rich enough information (event links and descriptions).

- **Astro Islands Integration:** Utilized Astro Islands to render the events widget, providing a seamless and optimized user experience.

- **Simple, Reusable Components:** The project incorporates a library of straightforward and adaptable components, promoting code efficiency and maintainability across various sections of the website.
