      <BeliefCard name="Article 2 - Purpose">
        Lone Rock Bible Church is a body of committed Christians who, out of
        obedience to Christ, are dedicated (1) to worship the living God (John
        4:23-24; Matt. 28:18-20: Acts 14:21); (2) to edify the saints for
        growth, service and stability (I Cor. 14:12; Eph. 4:11-16); and (3) to
        evangelize the unbelieving by assembling together (Heb. 10:25), training
        and commissioning for service (Acts 13:1-3), meeting physical and
        spiritual needs (Acts 4:32-35) and proclaiming biblical truths locally,
        regionally and world-wide (Matthew 28:18-20)

          <li>
            <strong>Bible</strong>
            <p>
              We believe the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the
              inspired Word of God (II Tim. 3:16), without error in the original
              writings (II Peter 1:20-21), the complete revelation of His will
              for the salvation of those who believe, and the divine and final
              authority for all Christian faith and life (II Peter 1:3-4).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Godhead</strong>
            <p>
              We believe in one God, (Deut. 6:4; I Tim. 2:5) Creator of all
              things, infinitely perfect and eternally existing in three
              persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit (II Cor. 13:14).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Person and Work of Jesus Christ</strong>
            <p>
              We believe that Jesus Christ is true God and true man (John 1:14;
              8:58; Phil. 2:6-8), having been conceived of the Holy Spirit (Luke
              1:35) and born of the Virgin Mary (Luke 1:31-34). He died on the
              cross a (better) sacrifice for our sins according to the Scripture
              (Romans 3:23-25). Further,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit</strong>
            <p>
              We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the
              Lord Jesus Christ (John14:26: 16:14), to convict and regenerate
              the sinner (John 3:5-8; 16:7-1; Titus 3:5-6); to indwell (Rom.
              8:9, 11), guide (John 16:13), instruct, and empower the believer
              for godly living and sacrifice.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Depravity of Man</strong>
            <p>
              We believe that man was created in the image of God (Gen.
              1:26-27), but fell into sin and is therefore dead in trespasses
              and sin. (Eph 2:1); only through regeneration by the Holy Spirit
              can salvation and spiritual life be obtained (Titus 3:5 & 6)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Salvation</strong>
            <p>
              We believe that the shed blood of Jesus Christ (Eph. 1:7) and His
              resurrection (Eph. 2:6) provide the only ground for justification
              and salvation (Rom. 5:8-11) for all who believe, and only such as
              receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord are born of the Holy
              Spirit, and thus become children of God (John 1:12-13; 3:3). We
              believe that water baptism (Matt. 3:13-17; Acts 8:36-39) and the
              Lord's Supper ( I Cor. 11:23-29) are ordinances to be observed by
              the Church;. They are not, however, to be regarded as means of
              salvation (Eph. 2:9).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Church</strong>
            <p>
              We believe that the true Church is composed of all such persons
              who have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and, through a saving
              faith in Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:8) are united together in the body
              of Christ of which He is Head (Rom 8:9;Epheisans 5:23; Col. 1:18;
              1 Cor 12:12-31). We believe that only those who are thus members
              of the true Church shall be eligible for membership in this church
              (Acts 2:47).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Second Coming of Christ</strong>
            <p>
              We believe in the personal and imminent coming of our Lord Jesus
              Christ (I Thess. 4:13-18). and that this "blessed hope" has a
              vital bearing on the personal life and service of the believer (1
              John 2:28-29; Titus 2:13-14).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Eternal State</strong>
            <p>
              We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead; of the believer
              to everlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord (Matthew
              25:31-34; Rev. 22:3-5); of the unbeliever to judgment and
              everlasting conscious punishment (II Thess. 1:8-9; Rev. 20:11-15).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marriage</strong>
            <p>
              We believe that the only Scriptural marriage is the joining of one
              man and one woman. (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; 1 Cor. 7:10; Eph.
              5:22-33) We believe that marriage is an institution created by God
              in which one man and one woman commit themselves to each other in
              covenant for life. (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; Mal. 2:14). We believe
              that a person’s gender is determined by God as evidenced by their
              reproductive organs at birth (Gen. 1:27).

            <strong>Authority of Doctrinal Statement</strong>
            <p>
              The Statement of Faith does not exhaust the extent of our faith.
              The Bible itself is the sole and final source of all that we
              believe. We do believe, however, that the foregoing Doctrinal
              Statement accurately represents the teaching of the Bible and,
              therefore, is binding upon all members. All literature, whether
              print or electronic, used in the church shall be in complete
              agreement with the Doctrinal Statement.

            <strong>Section 1. Standing</strong>
            <p>
              This church acknowledges the Lord Jesus Christ as its only head
              (Eph. 5:23; Colossians 1:18) and receives the Bible as the only
              infallible guide in matters of faith, church order and discipline
              2 Tim 3:16-17; (John 8:31; I Tim. 6:3-5), and is amenable to no
              other ecclesiastical body in matters interfering with church
              autonomy. As a Rocky Mountain Bible Mission member, Lone Rock
              Bible Church desires to remain autonomous; any organizational
              affiliation shall be for purposes of identification and ministry
              resource, and will exclude any hierarchical governmental
              influence.

              The business administration of this corporation shall be vested in
              and exercised primarily by the Elders (I Thess. 5:12-13; Heb.
              13:7, 17). These shall have authority to conduct, manage and
              control the business of the corporation, thus overseeing any and
              all such actions necessary toward executing the purposes of the
              corporation (I Pet. 5:1-3).
