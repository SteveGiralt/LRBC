      <BeliefCard name="The Bible">
        We believe the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the
        inspired Word of God (II Tim. 3:16), without error in the original
        writings (II Peter 1:20-21), the complete revelation of His will for the
        salvation of those who believe, and the divine and final authority for
        all Christian faith and life (II Peter 1:3-4).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="God">
        We believe in one God, (Deut. 6:4; I Tim. 2:5-6) Creator of all things,
        infinitely perfect and eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son
        and Holy Spirit (II Cor. 13:14).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="Jesus Christ">
        We believe that Jesus Christ is true God and true man (John 1:14; 8:58;
        Phil. 2:6-8), having been conceived of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35) and
        born of the Virgin Mary (Luke 1:26-33). He died on the cross a sacrifice
        for our sins according to the Scripture (Rom.3:24-26). Further, He rose
        bodily from the dead and ascended into heaven (I Cor. 15.4-8; Acts 1.9),
        where at the right hand of the Majesty on High (Heb. 1:2-4) He is now
        the believers High Priest and Advocate (Heb. 8:1).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="The Holy Spirit">
        We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord
        Jesus Christ (John14:26), to convict and regenerate the sinner (John
        3:5-8; 16:7-11); to indwell (Rom. 8:9), guide (John 16:13), instruct,
        and empower the believer for godly living and sacrifice.
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="Man">
        We believe that man was created in the image of God (Gen. 1:26-27), but
        fell into sin and is therefore lost (Rom. 3:23); only through
        regeneration by the Holy Spirit can salvation and spiritual life be
        obtained (Titus 3.5).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="Salvation">
        We believe that the shed blood of Jesus Christ (Eph. 1:7) and His
        resurrection (Eph. 2:6) provide the only ground for justification and
        salvation (Rom. 5:8-11) for all who believe, and only such as receive
        Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord are born of the Holy Spirit, and thus
        become children of God (John 1:12; 3:3).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="Church Ordinances">
        We believe that water baptism and the Lord's Supper are ordinances to be
        observed by the Church (Matt. 3:13-17; Acts 8:36-39; I Cor. 11:23-29).
        They are not, however, to be regarded as means of salvation (Eph. 2:9).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="The Church">
        We believe that the true Church is composed of all such persons who have
        been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and, through a saving faith in Jesus
        Christ (Eph. 2:8) are united together in the body of Christ of which He
        is Head (Rom 8:9; Col. 1:18). We believe that only those who are thus
        members of the true Church shall be eligible for membership in this
        church (Acts 2:37-42; 5:14).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="End Times">
        We believe in the personal and imminent coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
        (I Thess. 4:13-18). and that this "blessed hope" has a vital bearing on
        the personal life and service of the believer (1 John 2:28-29; Titus
        2:13). We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead; of the
        believer to everlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord (II Cor. 5:8;
        Rev. 22:3-5); of the unbeliever to judgment and everlasting conscious
        punishment (II Thess. 1:8-9; Rev. 20:11-15).
