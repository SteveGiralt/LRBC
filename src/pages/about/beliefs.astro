      <BeliefCard name="The Bible">
        We believe the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the
        inspired Word of God (II Tim. 3:16), without error in the original
        writings (II Peter 1:20-21), the complete revelation of His will for the
        salvation of those who believe, and the divine and final authority for
        all Christian faith and life (II Peter 1:3-4).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="The Godhead">
        We believe in one God, (Deut. 6:4; I Tim. 2:5) Creator of all things,
        infinitely perfect and eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son
        and Holy Spirit (II Cor. 13:14).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="The Person and Work of Jesus Christ">
        We believe that Jesus Christ is true God and true man (John 1:14; 8:58;
        Phil. 2:6-8), having been conceived of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35) and
        born of the Virgin Mary (Luke 1:31-34). He died on the cross a better
        sacrifice for our sins according to the Scripture (Romans 3:23-25).
        Further, He rose bodily from the dead and ascended into heaven (I Cor.
        15:1-4; Acts 1:1-2, 9), where at the right hand of the Majesty on High
        (Heb. 1:3) He is now the believers High Priest and Advocate (Heb. 8:1-2,
        9:24; 1 John 2:1).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit">
        We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord
        Jesus Christ (John14:26; 16:14), to convict and regenerate the sinner
        (John 3:5-8; 16:7-11; Titus 3:5-6); to indwell (Rom. 8:9, 11), guide
        (John 16:13), instruct, and empower the believer for godly living and
        sacrifice.
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="The Depravity of Man">
        We believe that man was created in the image of God (Gen. 1:26-27), but
        fell into sin and is therefore dead in trespasses and sin. (Eph 2:1);
        only through regeneration by the Holy Spirit can salvation and spiritual
        life be obtained (Titus 3:5-6).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="Salvation">
        We believe that the shed blood of Jesus Christ (Eph. 1:7) and His
        resurrection (Eph. 2:6) provide the only ground for justification and
        salvation (Rom. 5:8-11) for all who believe, and only such as receive
        Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord are born of the Holy Spirit, and thus
        become children of God (John 1:12-13; 3:3). We believe that water
        baptism (Matt. 3:13-17; Acts 8:36-39) and the Lord's Supper (I Cor.
        11:23-29) are ordinances to be observed by the Church. They are not,
        however, to be regarded as means of salvation (Eph. 2:9).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="The Church">
        We believe that the true Church is composed of all such persons who have
        been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and, through a saving faith in Jesus
        Christ (Eph. 2:8) are united together in the body of Christ of which He
        is Head (Rom 8:9; Ephesians 5:23; Col. 1:18; 1 Cor 12:12-31). We believe
        that only those who are thus members of the true Church shall be
        eligible for membership in this church (Acts 2:47).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="The Second Coming of Christ">
        We believe in the personal and imminent coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
        (I Thess. 4:13-18). and that this "blessed hope" has a vital bearing on
        the personal life and service of the believer (1 John 2:28-29; Titus
        2:13-14).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="The Eternal State">
        We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead; of the believer to
        everlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord (Matthew 25:31-34; Rev.
        22:3-5); of the unbeliever to judgment and everlasting conscious
        punishment (II Thess. 1:8-9; Rev. 20:11-15).
      </BeliefCard>

      <BeliefCard name="Marriage">
        We believe that the only Scriptural marriage is the joining of one man
        and one woman. (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; 1 Cor. 7:10; Eph. 5:22-33) We
        believe that marriage is an institution created by God in which one man
        and one woman commit themselves to each other in covenant for life.
        (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; Mal. 2:14). We believe that a person's gender is
        determined by God as evidenced by their reproductive organs at birth
        (Gen. 1:27).
