        <h4 class="font-bold mt-3 mb-2">A. The Elder Board</h4>
        <p class="mb-3">
          The spiritual affairs of Lone Rock Bible Church shall be managed by
          its Board of Elders (I Pet. 5:1-4; Acts 14:23). This Board of Elders
          may hereinafter be referred to as the "Elders". The Elders shall
          consist of not less than three (3) Elders, and shall function as the
          trustees of the corporation. In the event of having less than three
          elders, the Rocky Mountain Bible Mission executive board will be asked
          to provide an interim elder until a sufficient number of elders is
          available from the congregation. The number of elder positions may be
          modified, but not to less than the above-specified minimum, as
          determined by unanimous consent of the Elders. The Elders shall meet
          as a corporate body on a monthly basis (unless otherwise mutually
          agreed upon) for the expeditious conduct of church business. Church
          members are encouraged to attend board meetings to provide input,
          other than in matters requiring confidentiality. The Elders will
          achieve unanimous consent prior to implementation of proposals. Plans
          and decisions deemed to be of special significance by the Elders may
          be brought before the congregation for discussion.

      <BeliefCard name="ARTICLE 4. Church Discipline">
        <h3 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Section 1. Purpose</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Because Lone Rock Bible Church exists to promote the spiritual growth
          and well being of its membership, biblical principles affecting the
          discipline of its constituents shall be applied whenever a member's
          behavior seriously compromises biblical standards. This practice of
          church discipline is believed to be in the best interest both of the
          individual member and the corporate body in that it encourages
          accountability to one another toward an optimum expression of biblical
          Christianity. Relevant Scripture addressing such discipline includes
          Matthew 18:15-20; I Corinthians 5:1-13; Galatians 6:1-25;
          Thessalonians 3:1-15 and 1 Timothy 5:19-21. All church disciplinary
          action shall be conscientiously directed toward the restoration of the
          offender to the fellowship and his or her reconciliation with the
          offended person(s).
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Section 2. Procedure</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Under the oversight of the elders, Lone Rock Bible Church shall strive
          to follow Biblical guidelines in every case that leads to discipline.
          An observed transgression of biblical behavior shall first be lovingly
          confronted by the person(s) who witnessed the transgression. The
          confrontation shall include any clear evidence of wrong behavior as
          well as relevant biblical principles that have been violated. An
          invitation to repentance and parameters of accountability shall be
          proposed. If the invitation is rejected or accountability lapses, the
          intervention shall be repeated with the inclusion of the elders. If
          this does not bring about the necessary change(s), the congregation
          shall be informed of the problem and, if repentance and restoration do
          not occur, the offender shall be removed officially from the
          fellowship. Should such an unfortunate measure be necessary, both the
          church and the offender shall be informed that repentance and
          restoration remain the desired option. Further, should the removed
          member seek the sanction of another church, Lone Rock Bible Church
          must in all good conscience notify that church of the actions taken.

          Lone Rock Bible Church has the privilege and responsibility of
          providing its members and friends with biblically-based counseling to
          help them meet the challenges of the Christian life in a way that will
          bring honor to the Lord Jesus Christ and advance His kingdom. Trusting
          that the Bible provides complete instruction for Christian faith and
          practice, counseling will be based upon scriptural principles rather
          than on those of secular psychology or psychiatry.

          and/or lay counselors will be of a confidential nature and will not be
          divulged to others except; (1) when there is a clear indication that a
          party might otherwise be harmed; or (2) when unrepentant sin
          necessitates seeking the assistance of others in the church to carry
          out the instructions of the Bible for church discipline, especially as
          set forth in Matthew 18:15-20 and 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15.

          Church expects each believer to become involved in some facet of
          ministry. Every member is urged either to join an existing avenue of
          outreach or, in sensitivity to God's leading, to explore possibilities
          for new methods of reaching people with the gospel. The church shall
          seek to help believers learn their strengths and deploy them
          appropriately. (Romans 12:4-8; Cor. 12:1-11; 1 Peter 4:10)

          Lone Rock Bible Church (LRBC) makes its facility available to its
          members and to outside groups whose aims and practices are not in
          conflict with the Doctrinal Statement and approved by the Deacons. Any

        <h3 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Priorities of Use</h3>

        <p class="mb-3">
          The purpose of the Lone Rock Bible Church (LRBC) Benevolence Fund is
          to help our neighbors who are experiencing financial stress and are in
          need of short-term emergency assistance. Those who attend Lone Rock
          Bible Church will be our first priority.

        <h3 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Funding</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Funding is provided by LRBC and community members. Distribution is at
          the discretion of the Deacon Board. Reports will be given at least
          annually to the LRBC congregation, so there's transparency about how
          these funds are used. Names and situation will remain confidential.

        <h3 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Other Resources</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          We encourage neighbors who are in distress to make use of Pantry
          Partners (food) and the Free Store (clothing). In emergencies, we have
          members who can assist in getting an emergency food box, or opening up
          the Clothes Closet at non-business hours. Carpenters for Christ are
          often able to help with small home repair projects, outfitting
          bathrooms for handicap accessible features and building access ramps.

          Persons soliciting help from the LRBC Benevolence Fund are generally
          first referred to the Salvation Army staff person (Hamilton). She/he
          then checks names against a list of persons who have already received
          help and can ascertain what public resources may be available. The
          Ravalli County Ministerial Association each quarter emails us a list
          of those they have served. The Salvation Army Staff person will then
          either refer the person back to us, or direct them where they can
          receive the most appropriate assistance. The Salvation Army helps us
          pool resources with other charitable organization to allow us to offer
          a greater level of assistance than any one small organization can
          provide on our own. Households should generally not receive financial
          assistance more than once per quarter.

            receiving the card—drivers license, insurance card preferable.) This
            can be a bottomless pit in terms of helping people, so we try to
            limit the gas cards to true emergencies.

        <p class="mb-3">
          Paying for motel rooms is not recommended unless the weather is bad,
          since that reduces our funds rapidly, and does not solve the problem
          of what they are going to do the next day. However there are times
          when it is the best option. There are two alternatives: The motel on
          the highway, St Mary's, will sometimes allow transients to stay. Gene
          and Robbie Mim Mack of the Stevi Hotel have a boarding house and
          off-site housing available. Arrangements can be made to have them bill
          us when the Deacon Board approves it. If they are in need of a meal,
          the Stevi Café will provide a meal if pre-authorization by the Deacon
          Board.

          Proactive Gifts to Members of the Congregation
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          There are times when an elder or deacon becomes aware of a need within
          the congregation. In certain circumstances, we have found it helpful
          to offer help proactively by asking a person in the church who is
          struggling if there is a bill that it would be helpful for them to
          receive help with for a particular month. This is not intended to be a
          permanent solution for financial difficulty, but can be a hand up in a
          time of need.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Capacity/Referrals</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Persons in need of emergency assistance will first be directed to
          check in with other agencies like the Salvation Army, LIEAP (energy)
          or other larger organizations to insure we are not duplicating
          services. We have developed a good relationship with the Salvation
          Army coordinator, and she/he contacts us when they become aware of a
          need in the community we can meet together.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Recommended Allocation of Resources</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          First preference is given to those living in the Stevensville/Lone
          Rock community.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Policy for Assistance</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          No money goes directly to the person needing assistance, but is
          designated to a second party payee—e.g. for electricity, groceries,
          gas, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Generally not more than once a quarter for any one family or
          individual. Ravalli County Ministerial Association and Salvation Army
          both keep records that we can access to check on anyone who may be
          abusing the system by requesting help more than once a quarter.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Members of the church are encouraged to suggest persons or families
          who may need a little help. Individuals seeking assistance are
          referred to the Salvation Army first, where their needs will be
          assessed. If there are other organizations that can offer more
          appropriate help, they will be referred by the Salvation Army. The
          Salvation Army coordinator then contacts us, and, where the need is
          greater than any of the area benevolence funds can cover, the
          coordinates various organizations to help with a portion of the need.
