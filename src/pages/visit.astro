  <QandACard q="The Worship Service"
    >The service starts at 10 am, you are welcome to join us! We love to sing at
    Lone Rock and enjoy great music that seeks to exalt our Lord and Savior,
    Jesus Christ. The message is both powerful and practical for those who are
    just beginning their journey with Jesus Christ and those who have been on
    this amazing journey for many years.</QandACard
